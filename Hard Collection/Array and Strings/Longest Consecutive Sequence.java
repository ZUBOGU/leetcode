/* Longest Consecutive Sequence

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

Example:

Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

// Approach #2 Sorting [Accepted] Time complexity : O(nlgn)
// Approach #3 HashSet and Intelligent Sequence Building [Accepted]
// O(n+n)=O(n) for the while loop nested within for loop.
