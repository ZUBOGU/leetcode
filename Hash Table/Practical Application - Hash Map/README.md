# Practical Application - Hash Map

We have known that the hash set is able to store only values. On the other hand, the hash map is an implementation of map which is able to store (key, value) pairs.

With the ability to store more information, the hash map can help us to solve more complicated problems. For example, we can aggregate all the information by key using a hash map and look up for the information related to a specific key in average constant time.

In this chapter, we will go through different scenarios to make better use of the hash map.

## Hash Map - Usage

The hash map is one of the implementations of a map which is used to store (key, value) pairs.

We provide an example of using the hash map in Java, C++ and Python. If you are not familiar with the usage of the hash map, it will be helpful to go through the example.
