# Conclusion

We are now more familiar with the principle and usage of the hash table.

We have also talked about how to apply hash table from three respects in previous chapters. Here we combine them together and come up with a typical thinking process to solve problems by hash table flexibly.

What's more, we will meet more complicated problems sometimes. We might need to:

    use several hash tables together
    combine the hash table with other data structure
    combine the hash table with other algorithms
    ...

We provide some exercise in this chapter. After finishing this chapter, you will be more confident with hash table related problems.
